# StyleTransfer
Deep Learning End Semester Project - Done By Raj Uttam (ru388) and Neeharika Vangavaragu (nv911)\
\
In this project we've tried to implement neural style transfer using 2 techniques\
  i) Gathy's et al Implementation \
  ii) Instance Normilization Technique 

You'll find code for both these techniques in the form on Jupyter Notebooks

We've used google colab environment for developing this project and we suggest you to use the same.\
Please checkout Gaty's_method notebook first followed by Instance normilization notebook

Description of Files and Folders\
  i. Gaty's_Method.ipynb -: Jupyter Notebook File for Gaty's Method\
  ii. instance Normilization.ipynb -: Jupyter Notebook for the instance normilization Technique\
  iii. Gaty's output -: Output Images generated using Gaty's technique\
  iv. Instance Normilization - Input Images -: The input image files that are required for the Instance Normilization Notebook\
  v. Instance Normilization - Outputs :- Some Output Images generated using the Instance Normilization Technique\
